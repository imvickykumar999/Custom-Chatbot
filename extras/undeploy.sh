# Script: undeploy.sh
# Purpose: Cleans up all Kubernetes and Minikube resources created by deploy.sh.
#          This stops the port forwarding, deletes the deployment/service,
#          and finally stops the Minikube cluster.
#
# USAGE:
# 1. Save the file: chmod +x undeploy.sh
# 2. Run: ./undeploy.sh

# --- Configuration Variables (Must match deploy.sh) ---
K8S_YAML_FILE="k8s_deployment.yaml"
